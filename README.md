## <b> Objective </b>

This project involves analyzing the tagged doubts dataset of Unacademy learners. The main goal is to gain detailed insight into doubt matching, with the ultimate aim of improving our instant match. This will help to modify the existing model to increase the IM rate and provide quick and accurate solutions to learners' doubts.

Overall, this project will help the team move forward with the detailed strategy.

In this project, we have conducted exploratory data analysis on two types of cases:

No Match : These are cases where we did not provide any solution to the learners from our Question Bank (ES Top Match).
Correct/Incorrect Matches : These are cases where we have offered a solution to learners from our Question Bank, but we are uncertain whether the solution meets their expectations.

<b> Data Source </b>

Here is the source for the tagged doubt dataset. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HjP7U2IHcmWDTsQjuCKQ4z-wNqnXnTe86SnQKxt2RHg/edit?usp=sharing

The dataset contains 3100 rows and 16 or 18 columns respectively. Out of these, 2000 rows are labeled as "No Match", and 1100 rows are labeled as "Correct/Incorrect Matches".
